## Introduction

This project contains the following functions for common management, account management: 

**Common Service**

  - Improved user experience through automatic AT renewal between Frontend, API Gateway, and Account Service
  - Login functionality integrated with Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Account Management
  - Automated account creation and application process for system usage
  - User account lifecycle management
- Authorization (Access Control)
  - Role-based access control
  - Personalized access management through menu/button mappings for users outside of roles
  - API-level permission management via button-API mappings
- Activity Tracking
  - History management to ensure compliance with security standards
  - Tracking of changes in user account information and permission mappings
  - Logging of user activities such as login/logout, screen execution, and personal data downloads
  - Storing query history called by the backend via sqltrace

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Lombok
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Gradle 8.3 (or use the included Gradle wrapper)


## Project Structure

The project consists of the following modules:

- `common-service` - Main service implementation
- `common-export` - Common utilities and shared components
- `account-service` - Main service implementation
- `account-export` - Contains shared DTOs and interfaces

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd common
```

2. Start the required services using Docker Compose:

```bash
# start services: zookeeper, kafka, kafka-ui, redis, mysql
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

3. Start KeyCloak:

```bash
# start keycloak
docker-compose -f docker-compose-keycloak.yml up -d
```

4. Initialize the database:

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer to use the H2 database instead of mysql, please comment out the MySQL service in the docker-compose.yml file.
> Then, skip this step and proceed to the section titled "Running the Application with H2 Database."
>
> ![mysql-service.png](docs/imgs/mysql-service.png)

```bash
# list all container
  docker ps

# run mysql container
  docker exec -it mysql-common bash

# Login mysql
mysql -u root -p

# input MySql password in terminal (qwer1234)

# Run the SQL files
# Create Database
CREATE DATABASE OCO;

# Create Account
CREATE USER 'com_dev'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'qwer1234!';

# Grant permission
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON OCO.* TO 'com_dev'@'%â€™;

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

5. Connect by IDE

You can also connect to the MySQL container using an IDE tool like MySQL Workbench or another IDE that supports MySQL.
The setup steps are as follows:

- Open MySQL Workbench or the IDE you want to use.
- Set up a new connection with the following information:
    - **Hostname**: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
    - **Port**: 3307
    - **Database**: OCO
    - **Username**: root
    - **Password**: qwer1234!

- Test Connection: Check the connection to ensure you can access the MySQL server.
  You maybe need to set 'allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true' if necessary.

Once the connection is successful, you can use the graphical interface of the IDE to manage databases, perform SQL
queries, and interact with the data more easily.

After init schema and user, you must run sql script in 2 sql files (`query.sql`, `oif_query.sql`, `menu.sql` in the same folder of README).

First, run the script command in the `query.sql` file to create the tables.

Then, run the script command in the `oif_query.sql`

Then, run the script command in the `menu.sql` file to add sample data for the menu configuration.

6. Build the project:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> In case you get error `./gradlew: Permission denied` you should try to run one of these command  
>
>    -``sudo chmod +x ./gradlew``
>    
>    -``git update-index --chmod=+x gradlew``
> 
> Then retry from step 2 above.

7. Enable swagger:

Comment these lines ```enabled: false``` in application.yml or change to ```enabled: true``` (for development only)

```code
springdoc:
  api-docs:
    ...
    enabled: false
  swagger-ui:
    ...
    enabled: false
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Common Service:

```bash
./gradlew :common-service:bootRun
```

2. Start the Account Service:

```bash
./gradlew :account-service:bootRun
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can also run project in IDE likes IntelliJ, Eclipse, ...
> In case you get error when starting this project, you should check the project config:
> - JDK version
> - Gradle config
> - Proxy prevention
> - Try to remove '.gradle' folder inside project and rebuild gradle in step 2 (Build the project)

3. The Swagger Common API will be available at `http://localhost:9100/api/com/common/swagger-ui/index.html`

## Running the Application with H2 Database

1. Start the Common Service:

```bash
./gradlew :common-service:bootRun -Pprofile=test
```

2. Start the Account Service:

```bash
./gradlew :account-service:bootRun -Pprofile=test
```

3. H2 Console `http://localhost:9100/api/h2-console`
- Set up config login H2 Console:
  - **Saved Settings**: Generic H2 (Embedded)
  - **Setting Name**: Generic H2 (Embedded)
  - **Driver Class**: org.h2.Driver
  - **JDBC URL**: jdbc:h2:mem:common
  - **User Name**: sa
  - **Password**:
  - ![h2db.png](docs/imgs/h2db.png)

## Development

- Use `./gradlew build` to build all modules
- Use `./gradlew test` to run tests
- Use `./gradlew bootRun` to run the service locally

## Database Setup

The project includes SQL scripts for initial setup:

- `query.sql` - Database dump
- `oif_query.sql` - Database dump
- `menu.sql` - Menu-related data
